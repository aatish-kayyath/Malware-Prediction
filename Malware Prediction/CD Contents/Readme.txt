Troubleshooting and FAQ

1. The Application does not render properly on Internet Explorer
Solution - The rendering tools have a minimal requirement of Internet Explorer 9+ onwards. Please update your browser or use a different browser. 

2. The application takes too long to load and ends in not reachable
Solution - The server at the backend is not running or reachable. Contact the developer at aravindpanil@gmail.com and highlight the issue. 

3. The browser gives a 500 error
Solution - Simply refresh the browser and scan again. This happens when the server at the backend is dealing with multiple data at the same time. When the scan button is hit consecutively twice too fast, the server cannot deal with the incoming requests.
